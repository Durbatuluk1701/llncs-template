# Using This Template
1. Replace this readme with a description of the paper
2. Rename the file `samplepaper.tex` to something more meaningful
3. Add `samplepaper.pdf` (or whatever you name the paper) to the .gitignore file so you don't end up checking in the built PDF file
3. Edit the author section including emails, thanks and running header
4. Update `sldg.bib` if needed.  Pull from repo before updating to get latest entries.  Push back if you add entries.
5. Some includes are commented out as they are not always needed.  Uncomment what you need and add others as needed.
6. If you do not want to use `natbib` comment out the include and swap `bibliographystyle` commands at the end of the document.
